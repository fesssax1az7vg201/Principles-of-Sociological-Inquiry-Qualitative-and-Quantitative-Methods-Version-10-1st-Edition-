In *Principles of Sociological Inquiry: Qualitative and Quantitative Methods*, Blackstone stresses the importance of understanding research methods in order to pursue an advanced degree. As an active researcher herself, Blackstone is acutely aware of the need for a balanced approach of both qualitative and quantitative methods of sociological inquiry. Therefore, the three overriding objectives of this textbook are: Relevance, Balance, and Accessibility. Blackstone emphasizes the relevance of research methods for the everyday lives of its readers, undergraduate students.
